    "While linked lists provide certain benefits over regular lists and arrays, such as dynamic size and memory efficiency, they also have their limitations. Since pointers for each element must be stored to reference the next node, the memory usage per element is higher when using linked lists. Also, this data structure does not allow direct access to data. Accessing an element requires sequential traversal from the beginning of the list, resulting in O(n) search time complexity.\n",
