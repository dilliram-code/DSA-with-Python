**ğŸ©µ 1. What is Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)?**

`ğŸ”¹ Data Structure:`

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that operations like searching, insertion, deletion, and modification can be performed efficiently.

Examples:

- List / Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph
- HashMap (Dictionary in Python)

`ğŸ”¹ Algorithm:`

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a particular problem.

`Example:`

To find the largest number in a list:
```python
numbers = [10, 5, 22, 18, 7]
largest = numbers[0]
for num in numbers:
    if num > largest:
        largest = num
print("Largest number:", largest)
```
This is a simple linear search algorithm.

**âš¡ 2. Importance of DSA**

- ğŸ§© Helps you write efficient and optimized code.

- ğŸš€ Makes you a better problem solver.

- ğŸ’¼ Essential for tech interviews.

- ğŸ§  Helps in real-world applications like databases, AI, and web development.
