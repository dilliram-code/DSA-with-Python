    "- **A linked list** is a data structure that plays a crucial role in data organization and management. It contains a series of nodes that are stored at random locations in memory, allowing for efficient memory management. Each node in a linked list contains two main components: the data part and a reference to the next node in the sequence."

If a list needs to grow beyond its initial size, it must allocate a new, larger block of contiguous memory and then copy all existing elements to this new block. This process is time-consuming and inefficient, especially for large lists. On the other hand, if the initial size of the list is overestimated, the unused memory is wasted.\n",

    "While linked lists provide certain benefits over regular lists and arrays, such as dynamic size and memory efficiency, they also have their limitations. Since pointers for each element must be stored to reference the next node, the memory usage per element is higher when using linked lists. Also, this data structure does not allow direct access to data. Accessing an element requires sequential traversal from the beginning of the list, resulting in O(n) search time complexity.\n",
